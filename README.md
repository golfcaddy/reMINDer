# reMINDer

Dementia is now the leading cause of death in the UK, with over 850 000 sufferers. 

Myself and @jagribble set out to address the constant challenge faced by a person with Alzheimers: forgetfulness.

We created a webapp and an Alexa skill - this setup increases quality of life for the patient by gently reminding them to complete everyday tasks and attend appointments. 

The patient can interact with the app and add reminders using voice or via a tablet. The app communicates with their carer in real-time using WebSockets.

Carers can also benefit from our app since they can set reminders remotely, which could be useful to provide extra care for a family member whilst you are at work, for example.

We used Node.js for this project because we were both familiar with the language - [express generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) was invaluable in getting up and running quickly.

Heroku provided an excellent development and hosting environment, while [socket.io](http://socket.io/) streamlined our setup of WebSockets.
