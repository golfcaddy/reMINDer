A reminder app for Amazon Alexa to help people with Alzheimers



As part of the student programme, myself and @jagribble created a webapp and an Alexa skill to help people suffering from Alzheimers.

The patient can interact with the app using voice or via a tablet, which communicates with their carer in real-time using WebSockets.
